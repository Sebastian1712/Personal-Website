# Sebastian's Personal Website ðŸŒ±
This website is a place where I host an extended more accurate version of what I would call my _resume_. ðŸ“ƒ
It goes more in detail on my experiences in the tech industry and the projects I have worked on during my time in college ðŸ“š.

This website also contains a _Self_ page, which demonstrates who I am outside of the computer science real,. It will have my passions, my thoughts about different topics, and it will contain different explorations through Computer Science. âœ¨

Feel free to check it out! [Sebastian's Website](https://sebastian1712.github.io/Personal-Website/)
